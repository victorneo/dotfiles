### Dotfiles

A collection of configuration files that I am using to simplify my setup of:

- alacritty
- nvim
- tmux
- zed

### Instructions

1. Install `tmux` and `nvim` if you have not, eg. `brew bundle`
2. Clone this repository, preferably to your `~` home directory
3. Run `./setup-wsl.sh` or `./setup-unix.sh` script and it should set up the soft links automatically

If using Alacritty, install the [Hack font](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack)
and the [patched Hack Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) before
proceeding.
